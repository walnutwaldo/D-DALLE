# D-DALLE
D-DALLE stands for Decentralized DALL-E. This app is deployed live at [ddalle.xyz](https://ddalle.xyz) on [Klaytn](https://klaytn.foundation/) mainnet.
The AI used in this work is [DALLE-2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) created by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/).

## About
Do you ever need to quickly find an image for a presentation / website and end up finding nothing good? Wouldn’t it be great 
if you had an automated art assistant always at your side to create art exactly to your imagination? With recent changes in technology,
we will show that this is now possible. First, AI has recently become so powerful that people can use it to become overnight artists. 
And moreover, blockchain has given us a proven way to collect people’s efforts together, align their financial incentives, and focus them
towards some goal.

Let’s say you are a marine biology student and would like some cute digital art of sea animals for your presentation tomorrow. 
Luckily, you know about D-DALLE (or Decentralized DALLE). You can just go to our site at ddalle.xyz and submit a description of 
the kind of image you are looking for. Over a short waiting period, other people on the platform, powered by DALLE’s AI art generation tools, 
which can make infinite amounts of completely new art at the press of a button, start to submit pieces of artwork that they will you would want 
to use. And after a certain time period, you can choose your favorite piece, the person who submitted that piece wins the bounty, and you go 
home with artwork in the top percentile of what any human could produce.

## Two-Sided Market

**Sponsors** want artwork for some purpose and propose bounties for pieces of art that meet a description they provide. After a given time period,
they get to review art submissions and award a bounty to one of the proposers.

**Proposers** generate art using our free DALL-E 2 interface which the sponsor gets to choose from. If a proposer's piece wins, they win the assigned bounty.
Proposers also get NFTs of their artwork, which can be viewed in collections on <a href="https://opensea.io/">OpenSea</a>
